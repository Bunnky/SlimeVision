### Slime Vision is a Slimefun Addon that gives people a way to visualize their Slimefun machines with ease, and locate SF Block Storage data.

## How it works
Slime Vision allows players to craft various types of 'Slime Eyes.' Once crafted, right-clicking with a Slime Eye will cause all Slimefun machines (excluding multi-block machines) within the eye's radius to glow. There's a small/medium crafting chain to create Slime Eyes like you would expect, and there's even a Networks specific Slime Eye that will only mark Network blocks if Networks is installed on the server. Network Slime Eyes make it much easier to differentiate between vanilla glass and Networks glass!

All Slime Eyes have their own cooldowns and radii. Lower tier Slime Eyes (like the Slime Chunk) have smaller radii, but shorter cooldowns, and higher tiers have larger radii, but longer cooldowns. This incentivizes the more performance friendly Slime Eyes. All Slime Eyes activate for 10 seconds per use.

Slime Vision's Particle items are mostly just used for crafting, however that's not all they are for! While holding a Particle item (mainhand, offhand, or both), players can right-click to shoot a particle beam in a short distance. These can be useful for pointing things out to someone, like a laser pointer!

## Important info
Slime Eyes can be performance-intensive, so use them wisely. Originally designed for server admins to diagnose BlockStorage issues, Slime Eyes have been balanced to minimize server impact while still providing valuable functionality. Most of the heavy hitters are admin only items, like the Slime God. It is recommended that admins use these tools during maintenance or a time when performance isn't an issue.

In the event of server crashes or rollbacks, Slime Eyes can help identify blocks that were replaced with Slimefun machines, as well as find invisible machines. If you have duplicate block or slimefun related errors on load, Slime Eyes can help diagnose those as well. The plugin includes tools like the Golden Slime Fish for BlockStorage cleaning and an SFS for manual Slimefun saves. Slime God and SFS require OP privileges, but the GFS doesn't in case server owners would like to give that out to players. Admin items do not appear in the guide at all, and are only available with /sf give.
